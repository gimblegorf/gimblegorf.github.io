		<p>Project 1 – Game design
Introduction:
I made a platformer using construct 3, and what you had to do was get past enemies that will kill you and get to the door to another level. In the game I put in 2 levels +1 if it was saved, with 2 enemy types.
Goal:
My goal was to make a working platformer that was fun and had at least 2 levels and working enemies.
Process:
When I started most of the time was trying to think about what my partner and I were going to do. We thought to make a maze game but then it just turned into a platformer. We didn’t care much about the sprites and so they are really simple. We set up the game by putting sprites on to a layout, but you need to add a behaviour on to a sprite through the layout and then you have to program it by going into the event sheet and selecting different things that will make the sprites move and other things.
We added a timer to the first level but forgot/ didn’t realize to put it onto the second level. The game has enemies that move left to right and change direction when they bump it to a solid object and the game has turrets that move at a speed of 180 degrees per second and shoots once per 2 seconds.
Complications: 
When we were making multiple enemies we didn’t know we could drag things in from the sides so we were making a new platform every time we wanted a new one, so when we made another enemy we made the sprite and did all the behaviours and programed it in the event sheet the other enemy stopped working, so we deleted it and found out that we could drag things from the side. Another one I had was less of a complication and more just inconvenient which was making the turrets directions and speed because numbers make it too fast or too slow, and I think I made it just in the middle and it still feels a little slow.
Results:
In the end we made a functioning game with 2 levels one is horizontal and one is vertical and we made 2 different enemies as said in the process section. The game looks really simple because we didn’t focus on the sprites that much and just focused on the game.
